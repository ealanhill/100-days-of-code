# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
Determined that layout for the home screen of the app, I'm going to be using a (`MotionLayout`)[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/motion/MotionLayout.html] to replicate the actionbar collapse you see with a `CoordinatorLayout`. Set up databinding and the layouts for the items in the homescreens `RecyclerView`.

**Thoughts**
Well, it's a bit hard to focus on just coding for an hour. I feel like I've fallen out of practice for the past couple weeks.
